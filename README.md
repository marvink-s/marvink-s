# About me

I'm an energy economics master graduate and very interested to enhance my coding skills in any way.

I'm currently working on an ETL energy data project to combine different skill sets into one coherent project.

I'm mainly interested in learning Python, SQL in combination with visualization tools like PowerBI and general data pipelines to build meaningful data pipelines in order to get insights from a vast amount of data and to play around with appropriate models.
